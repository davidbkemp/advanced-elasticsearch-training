# Advanced Elasticsearch Training

Warning:
This training material has not really been designed for self guidance.
It assumes an instructor will verbally explain a lot of the material.

This material also assumes that you have already covered the basics including
simple queries, index mappings, relevancy scoring, and custom analysers.

See, for example, https://jamesfer.me/intro-elasticsearch-training/#1

## Topics

- Nodes, shards, replicas, master nodes
- Query profiling
- Aggregations
- Nested objects
- Parent/child docs
- Field Collapsing
- Geospatial data
- Logstash
- Suggesters
- Controlling scores
- Percolators

## Prerequisites

You need to install various software tools.

Requirements:

- Docker (if on OSX, Docker for Mac is recommended)
- docker-compose


## Notes

There are scripts in the `scripts` directory that use docker-compose to create, stop and destroy an Elasticsearch + Kibana environment.

If you have previously run a different version of Elasticsearch with these scripts,
especially anything before version 7.17.5
then it may be best to destroy your existing Elasticsearch data with `scripts/destroy`.

Create an environment with:
```bash
scripts/up
```

Elasticsearch should now be available on `http://localhost:9200`

Kibana should now be available on `http://localhost:5601`

Stop the environment with:
```bash
scripts/down
```
Data is persisted so a subsequent `scripts/up` will start up ES and Kibana with your data still there.

Cleanup the environment and delete all data with:
```bash
scripts/destroy
```
