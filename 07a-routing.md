# Routing

## Default Routing

### Insert
When a document is inserted, by default it is _routed_ to a shard based on a hash of its document id.

```
PUT /agency/_doc/ABCXYZ
```

### Get by Id
When fetching a document, the same hashing is used so the fetch can be directed to the correct shard.

```
GET /agency/_doc/ABCXYZ
```

### Search
Searches are forwarded to all shards

```
GET /agency/_search
```

## Explicit Routing

You can over-ride the routing by specifying a _routing_ parameter when you save the document.

Suppose you want all agency documents belonging to the same suburb to be co-located in the same shard,
then you could use the suburb name as the routing parameter

### Insert

```
PUT /agency/_doc/ABCXYZ?routing=brunswick
```

![Explicit Routing](./07-routing-diagrams/ExplicitRouting.svg)

### Get by Id

You **must** specify the routing parameter when fetching the document.

```
GET /agency/_doc/ABCXYZ?routing=brunswick
```

### Search

By default, it will still forward the search to all shards.

But, you **may** specify the routing parameter when searching (not mandatory).

```
GET /agency/_search?routing=brunswick
```

This can potentially increase your throughput (searches per second).
